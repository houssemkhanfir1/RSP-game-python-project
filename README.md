Rock, paper, scissors is a game played by using hands which can also be used as a toss when a decision on something between two or more people cannot be made.
<br>To play this game, participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then put their hands forward forming the shape of either of the three. 
<br> Making a fist represents rock, an open hand with palm facing down represents paper and two fingers (index and middle finger) extended represents scissors. 
<br> In this project, you will find the code to make a simple version of this game.
In order to create a rock paper scissor game, you should be fully familiar with the rules of the game. 
<br> The rules state that rock smashes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. 
So, rock wins over scissors, scissors win over paper and paper wins over rock. 
With the understanding of the rules, you can proceed to percieve the game code.
<br> While this game in python may seem basic, it’s a great starting point for learning programming concepts like conditional statements, functions, and modules.
